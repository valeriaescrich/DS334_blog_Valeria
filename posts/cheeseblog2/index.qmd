# Introduction

Cheese is consumed around the world because of its taste, texture and nutritional content. While cheese is often brought in conversations for their origins or flavor, fat content plays an important role in taste and texture, impacting how creamy, rich or dense the cheese feels. It is crucial to understand how fat content varies across different types of cheese and how this explains why cheeses have different textures.

In this exploration, I work with a dataset of cheeses collected from cheese.com and available through TidyTuesday project(https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-06-04/readme.md). The dataset contains 1,187 cheeses from around the world. Each cheese is described by variables like milk source, country of origin, cheese type, texture, flavor, aroma, and fat content. However, only 248 cheeses report fat content, so our investigation will be based on this specific subset.

The variables of interest:\
Fat Content (quantitative) Cheese type (categorical) Texture (categorical)

## Research Question

Is fat content associated with different types of cheese, and how does texture help explain this differences?

#1. Fat Content Categories Across Common Cheese Types

```{r}
fat_count = cheese_clean |>
  group_by(fat_content) |>
  summarise(n=n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n))|>
  slice(1:8)

cheese_fat = cheese_clean|>
  left_join(fat_count,by = "fat_content") |>
  filter(!is.na(n))

type_count = cheese_fat |>
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(n_type = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n_type))|>
  slice(1:8)

cheese_fat2 = cheese_fat|>
  inner_join(type_count,by = "type")

ggplot(cheese_fat2,
       aes(x= type))+
  geom_bar(fill = "wheat3") +
  facet_wrap(~fat_content)+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(
    title = "Fat content categories across common cheese types",
    x = "Cheese type",
    y = "Number of cheeses",
  )+
  theme_minimal() 
```

Our faceted bar chart shows the number of cheeeses by cheese type that fall under each fat content category, with each panel corresponding to a specific fat percentage. Because we have a common baseline, we can compare cheese types with same fat category.

Particularly for fat content 45% and 50%, soft and semi soft cheeses were more frequent, meaning that higher fat cheeses are usually softer. In the other hand, hard cheeses and artisan hard are less consistent and concentrated in a specific category.

Low fat cheeses are less common in our dataset and not evenly distributed across cheese types.

Main takeaways from our visual aid, fat content varies across cheese types, softer cheese has a tendency to be high on fat. This visualization addresses my research question by exposing how common cheese types are disributed across different fat contents, allowing us to compare each fat level.

# 2. Fat Content Categories Across Common Cheese Textures

```{r}
cheese_texture = cheese_clean|>
  select(texture,fat_content)|>
  filter(!is.na(texture))

fat_count2 = cheese_texture |>
  group_by(fat_content)|>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  slice(1:8)

cheese_texture2 = cheese_texture |>
  left_join(fat_count2, by = "fat_content")|>
  filter(!is.na(n))

texture_count = cheese_texture2 |>
  group_by(texture)|>
  summarise(n_texture = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n_texture))|>
  slice(1:8)

cheese_texture3 = cheese_texture2 |>
  inner_join(texture_count, by = "texture")

texture_fat_counts = cheese_texture3|>
  group_by(texture, fat_content)|>
  summarise(n=n())

ggplot(texture_fat_counts, aes(x = fat_content, y = texture, fill = n))+
  geom_tile()+
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between cheese texture and fat content",
    x = "Fat content category",
    y = "Cheese texture",
    fill = "Number of cheeses"
  )+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()


```

This heatmap shows the relationship between cheese texture and fat content by showing how frequently each texture and fat combination appears in our dataset. A clear patterns is exposed with creamy and smooth textures concentrated in higher fat content categories, around 45% and 50% fat. These combinations are more frequent than firmer or open textures at the same fat levels.

Firmer textures were more evenly distributed across fat categories and are less often in high fat levels. Textures are additional explanation in understanding the levels of fat a cheese might have.

This visualization demonstrates that fat content is not only associated with cheese type it is also linked with texture. The clustering of creamy and smooth for high fat levels helps us explain why high fat cheeses are more rich and softer. Focusing on texture for this plot, we get further understanding on how fat content influence cheese caharacteristics.

# Wrap-up

Our exploration susggests that fat content has a strong relation with cheese type, with softer cheeses appearing more frequently in higher fat content category. When diving into textures, we observe even more this already established relationship, creamy and smooth textures cluster at higher fat levels, providing an explanation on why cheeses with high fat content tend to feel richer and softer. These visualizations help to show that fat content play a crucial role in shaping both the classification and physicial characteristics of cheese.

Responding our research question : Is fat content associated with different types of cheese, and how does texture help explain this differences? Fat content is clearly associated with cheese type, soft and semi soft cheeses are more frequent at higher fats and hard cheeses are often in low fat levels. Texture helps explain this pattern because higher fat cheeses have a tendency to be creamy and smooth, and low fat cheeses are more firm and crumbly, connecting fat to the physical structure of cheese.

Some existing limitations of this study is that even thoigh our dataset consisted of pver 1,100 cheeses, only 248 reported their fat content, restricting our conclusion or perhaps generalizing. In addition, fat content is reported as categorical ranges instead of continuous, limiting how precise our comparisons were. Also, our dataset is based on descriptive labels such as texture, which can be subjective and not consistent among audiences.

For future explorations, it would be interesting to observe the interaction of fat witjh milk source or country of origin. Using more of the variables can help us get more context and ability to compare. Despite all the limitations our visualizations do expose meaningful patterns and do provide valuable insight of how fat content levels impact type and texture.

# Connection to Class Ideas

The goal of this blog post is not only to talk about cheese and make graphs, but to select appropiate visualizations that are interpretable by general audiences. Our reading emphasize that effective graphs depend on structure of the daa and hos humas perceive visual encodings, not just what looks good.

To get this spot on, I avoided unstable baselines, stacked bars, for the main comparisons. Instead my first visualization uses same position along a common axis comparing counts with each fat content panel. This is easy for readers to compare cheese types avoiding any perception issues. Our second visualization useas a heatmap, which we studied in 234. This plot shows frequency using color, it is effective because it helps the reader quickly observe a pattern, cluster and concentration across all of our categories. I used the correct color palette, sequential since its a uniform color scale.

Fat content was treated categorically rather than numerically (transforming it) because values are inconsistent, since its single percentage and ranges. In addition, our main goal was to compare patterns across cheeese characteristics instead of precise numeric responses.

Overall, my choices were intended to reduce clutter, focus attention on those patterns that help respond my research question, and support an honest and interpretable story on how fat content relates to cheese type and how texture explains those differences.
