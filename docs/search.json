This shows that tutoring demand is strongly tied to the semester, with Fall being the highest demand semester.\nThrough the years we can observe how Fall has declined, while Spring demand fluctuates, having a drop 2023 and then increasing in 2024. The main takeaway is at least until 2024, peer tutoring demand is not steadily increasing or decreasing over time, it varies depending on the year nad semester. This suggests that staffing decisions should be based on the semester and yearly behavior."

Some others are biology, physics, and economics.\nWe can conclude that staffing decisions should prioritize in recruiting tutors in intro to chemistry, statistics, biology, physics and economics. If our tutors are not aligned with this demand, students who request help in these courses may face limited access to support.\nBeyond staffing, this bar plot informs outreach strategy. Instead of promoting peer tutoring equally across all departments, our program should target the high demand coursed directly.\nThis plot identifies where students are most actively seeking help, and is an opportunity to use it for recruitments planning and creating outreach strategies."

Some might have retired.\nIt is important for me to emphasize that this visualization it is not an evaluation of teaching quality. Professors are referenced because when requesting a tutor they are requested to indicate their professors name. High counts could potentially reflect large enrollment in these specific courses, rigurous content, or strong support of the faculty to our program.\nDr. Samuel Tartakoff appears more frequently, followed by Dr. Patrick Lutz and Dr. Nadia Marano. The distribution is not evenly spread across all instructors, but instead clustered in specific courses.\nFrom the perspective of the Peer Tutoring program, this information is valuable for planning a strategic outreach. Based on this we can reach out this faculty memebers to promote our services, request 10 minutes in their class to do our presentation and introduce our services, coordinate peer tutor drop-in hours based on peak assessment periods or in general promote collaboration between our program and specific departments. Our main goal is to allign our support to the student needs. Based on this plot we can better allocate our tutors, anticipate demand, and build tight connections with faculty memeber in highly requested courses."

    "text": "Wrap-Up\nThis analysis shows the trends from 2021 to 2024, like high demand courses and frequently referenced professors. The visualizations expose meaningful patters but there are some limitations.\nOne of the biggest limitations is data preparation, particularly for professor names. When requesting a peer tutor, students have to manually type the professors name, therefore there are some inconcistencies due to abbreviations, misspellings, and missing elements. Although I tried to clean the most comong variations with string replacements, the counts for professors are not precise or entirely accurate. There may still be uncorrected spelling differences. The last plot should be interpreted as an approximation of demand patterns.\nAnother limitation is that our data set is only based on request counts only. It does not consider university or course enrollment, or tutor availability during high demand.\n\nNotable Insights\nOne interesting pattern is the evident drop in Spring 2023 requests compared to Fall 2022 or 2023. This decline might reflect changes in our programs visibility, student behavior, staffing or marketing efforts changed.\nFall demand remains overall higher than Spring through the years. This impacts staffing and outreach.\n\n\nFuture Direction\nSome aspects that could strengthen this analysis is compare tutor requests to enrollment size, keep track of the repeated request tracking, use prior semesters to predict future demand and based on it the staffing plans, and compare the demand before and after putting more efforts in outreach initiatives and collaborating with faculties."

    "text": "Connection to Class Ideas\nThe chosen visualizations were selected on previous content in our class readings or class code.\nFirst, our line graph for semester demand uses a common scale. We have discussed how the position in our axis helps with accuracy in our perception when it comes to quantitative comparison. The use of color helps distinguish semesters, and we avoid visual clutter.\nSecond, the horizontal bar chart for top courses uses a common baseline supporting the comparison. Reordering helps guide attention to the most important categories. Flipping coordinates, made the labels more clear and accessible.\nThird, the lollipop plot helps reduce ink and still romotes accurate comparison. This goes very in hand to our reading concept of maximizing data-to-ink ratio without sacrificing interpretation.\nAcross all of our plots we did not have 3D effects, consistent color usage and clear labels.\nOverall the Peer Tutoring Program demand follows patterns across semesters and is concentrated in specific handful of challenging courses. Requests have a tendency to be stronger in the Fall and less busy during the Spring, with some changes over time. These trends suggest that the Peer Tutoring Program needs are related to the course structure, providing valuable insights about our plans for staffing and targeted outreach."

Because we have a common baseline, we can compare cheese types with same fat category.\nParticularly for fat content 45% and 50%, soft and semi soft cheeses were more frequent, meaning that higher fat cheeses are usually softer. In the other hand, hard cheeses and artisan hard are less consistent and concentrated in a specific category.\nLow fat cheeses are less common in our dataset and not evenly distributed across cheese types.\nMain takeaways from our visual aid, fat content varies across cheese types, softer cheese has a tendency to be high on fat. This visualization addresses my research question by exposing how common cheese types are disributed across different fat contents, allowing us to compare each fat level."
